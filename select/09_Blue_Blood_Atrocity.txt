Still being of Nobble Birth
Though having Oppressed the Earth
Being better off than all
Contrasting with the rabble
Still crowning each other
Insisting on the old manners
Celebrating splendid feasts
Representation of the states

Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society!

Living in Gorgeos world
Having money and much gold
Stories in the gossip column
Showing up in a high position
Still possessing power and might
Being proud of their descent
Supported by the media
The blind crowds cheer them
Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society!

Pride - Class - Hatred - Opalance - Arrogance
Take their jewels and their gold
Occupy their castles
Seize their landed property
Drive aristocrates away
Residing in a palace
Wearing expensive clothes
Peoples should be fascinated
But appearances are deceptive
Lies - Pulling Your Mind - Sham - Cheat

Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society!
