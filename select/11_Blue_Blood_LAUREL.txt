Bl-blow it up
Let the horses run
I used to kill for fun
We're filthy rich sitting on the tail end of love

You woke me up for your blue blood
Made me come undone
Can't believe you've been here the whole time

Too nice to pass you by and I can't believe
You've been here the whole time

You made me feel again
Made me dance circles 'round the pieces of your heart
You made me feel again
After the last time, didn't think that I could love

Living by the sea
No one could set me free
Before you came to me
I was in a pretty dark place praying for the end
Your so sugar sweet
So easy to make you fall
Hell for leather, hell for sure
Always adore and endure I will love you
To nice to pass you by
I can't believe
You've been here the whole time

You made me feel again
Made me dance circles 'round the pieces of your heart.
You made me feel again
After the last time, didn't think that I could love

You made me feel again
Made me dance circles 'round the pieces of your heart

You made me feel again
After the last time, didn't think that I could love
